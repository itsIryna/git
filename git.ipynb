    "git --version Displays the currently installed version of Git. This is useful to verify if Git is installed and to check which version you are using.\n",

    "Create\n",
    "git init Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. This command creates a .git folder that tracks all version history and changes for the project.\n",

    "git add <filename> Adds specific files to the staging area, preparing them to be committed. This tells Git to start tracking changes made to these files.\n",

    "Save changes\n",
    "git commit -am \"<commit_message> Saves the staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message explaining the purpose of the changes. The -a flag automatically stages modified files (but not new ones), and the -m flag allows you to add the commit message inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Help\n",
    "git help <command> Displays the help documentation for a specific Git command. For example, git help init provides detailed information about the git init command. This is useful for learning about command options and usage.\n",

    "\n",
    "The file is identical to the version stored in the last commit.\n",
    "No changes have been made since the last commit.\n",
    "This is often referred to as the clean state because there are no pending changes.\n",
    "Modified (Changed):\n",
    "\n",
    "The file has been altered in the working directory compared to the last committed version.\n",
    "Git detects that changes have been made but these changes are not yet staged for the next commit.\n",
    "Staged (Indexed/Prepared):\n",

    "A .gitignore file is used in Git to specify files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by version control. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build outputs, sensitive information (like API keys), and system-specific files that are not relevant to the project's codebase.
